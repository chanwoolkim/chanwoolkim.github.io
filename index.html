<p><b>Bio: </b>I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://economics.uchicago.edu">Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics</a> at the <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu">University of Chicago</a>. <br><br>
I am an applied microeconomist with a focus on public economics and household finance. I am interested in investigating equilibrium outcomes and optimal policy design in situations where public and private programs overlap or compete and how such interactions influence the behavior of those affected by relevant government policies. My research includes topics related to real estate, utility bills, and municipal finance. <br><br>
Before joining the PhD program, I was a Research Professional at the <a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu">University of Chicago Booth School of Business</a>, a Research Assistant at the <a href="https://cehd.uchicago.edu">Center for the Economics of Human Development</a>, and a Research Assistant at the <a href="https://bfi.uchicago.edu">Becker Friedman Institute for Research in Economics</a>. I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2017 with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics (with Honors), in Public Policy Studies (with Honors), and in Statistics, and a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics. <br><br>
Note: I served in the Republic of Korea Army as an intelligence and operations administrator from 2020 to 2022. I returned to the University of Chicago in March 2022 to resume my research.</p>
