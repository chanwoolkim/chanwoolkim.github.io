<h3>Saving Sergeant Lee</h3>
The University of Chicago Korean Student Organization's 35th Annual Culture Show
<br>

<h4>Synopsis</h4>
As his days of service in the Korean army come to an end, Sergeant Noah Lee is given some advice, some words of wisdom that are to unlock for him a world previously unknown-a world in which he is no longer single. However, it is not too long after returning to college as plain old Noah that he starts to question the legitimacy of the advice he received—he was having little success. Only to further complicate matters, at the peak of his failure, Noah also meets the love of his life—a typical case of love at first sight. Armed with a terrible set of advice along with a pure, earnest, but often-mistaken heart, can Noah still win her over? Who will come to his rescue, if anyone? Or, is he simply destined, as he believed for most of his life, for a life of singleness?
